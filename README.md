#PicFix Final Project, Business 92 - Introduction to Python
#
#PicFix is a one-stop-shop where you can upload pictures they need printed and framed. 
#We offer our standard 8x4 prints as cheap as 15 cents per photo, so you can print as many as you’d like or need at an affordable price. 
#Our largest print size we offer is 5 x 4 at only 35 cents per photo. 
#If your photo needs a more worthy display, we suggest printing onto our 24x12 canvas for only $5.00. 
#PicFix offers many canvas size options for you to pick from that are budget friendly. 
#If you need a frame to accompany your prints or canvases feel free to choose from any of our colors: white, silver, mahogany, black, and gold. 
#Our services also include binding photos into an album at many different price points to fit your budget. 
#You can choose to have as many pages as 10 to 50 pages under $55.00. Our target customers are for those who want to save time and effort. 
#They’ll be allowed to order prints all in one checkout and delivered to their door. 
#No more needing to travel physically to a photo printing kiosk and then another store for frames or albums.
